## Requirements

This program is meant to be used when you do a Xorg-server installation for Arch Linux. The following recommendations are:

- Install Pipewire
- Install GRUB
- Enable swap on zram
- Install `python` and `git` beforehand

> **Note:** This program was tested in Python 3.13.5, for now, this program should be run in `python>=3.13.5` versions.

## Usage

You should run the `main.py` script to start deploying the DE in the whole system. Then you should just type the option you want to execute. You can install everything _(recommended)_ or just install each one of the phases, step by step.

```sh
python main.py
```
